                        <p>USSD allows for interactive, menu driven, 2-way communication between subscribers and applications and offers a quick and direct way of transacting with clients.<br /><br /> 

USSD works over mobile channels as sessions, or “conversations”. The user communicates with an application by navigating through a menu based structure. Customized menus and services can be easily created using Planet’s proprietary USSD builder. USSD technology requires no software installation on the handset or SIM card. A session can be initiated by the mobile user or the back-end system, using an SMS, voice call, predefined web trigger or a USSD short code.</p>
